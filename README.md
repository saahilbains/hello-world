My name is Saahil and I'm here to learn web development. 
I've been a Marketing Professional for my carrer of over 11 years and have worked at leading advertising agencies.
In my present assignment I've been working as a Product Marketing Manager for an augmented reality app. 
Unfortunately the app is being scrapped and I've been handed a pink slip. 
I'm working towards enhancing my skill set to increase the longevity of my career.
